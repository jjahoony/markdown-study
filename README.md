### Heading
- Use  ___`#`___  to make a heading ( The title ).
</br>One `#` in markdown is same as `<h1>` tag in html.

- For example, `#` = `<h1>`  ,  `##` = `<h2>`  ,  `###` = `<h3>` ... 

### Paragraph
- Use `Enter` key ( blank line ) to make a paragraph. 
</br>These are same as `<p>` tag in html.

- To break the line, use `</br>` tag same as in html or end the line with two more spaces.  
- Use `Enter` key ( blank line ) and five spaces or `tab` key makes a black box.  
  
      For example, like this.


### Emphasis
- Bold
  - __bold__
  - There are two defferent types of bold in markdown. 
    - `**bold**`
    - `__bold__`
  
  - Both `**bold**` and `__bold__` are same as `<strong>` tag in html.

- Italic
  - _italic_
  - There are two defferent types of italic in markdown.
     - `*italic*`
     - `_italic_`
  
  - Both `*italic*` and `_italic_` are same as `<em>` tag in html.
  
- Bold + Italic
   - ___bold + italic___
   - There are four defferent types of bold + italic.
      - `***bold + italic***`
      - `**_bold + italic**_`
      - `*__bold + italic__*`
      - `___bold + italic___`
  
  - These four tags are same as `<strong><em>` tag in html.
### Blockquotes
- > Blockquote
  
      Use `>` to make a blockquote.

- >Blockquote
  >
  >paragraph

      To make a blockquote paragraph, use `>` instead of `Tab` key or `Enter` key.
- >Nested
  >
  >>blockquote

      To make a nested blockquote, use `>>` after `>`. This is to put the blockquote inside the blockquote.
  
  For example,
  
  `>` Nested<br>
  `>`<br>
  `>>` blockquote
